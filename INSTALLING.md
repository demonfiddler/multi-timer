# Installing the Product

## Pre-requisites

The application runs on the Java VM and requires version 14 or later to be present before the installed executable can execute. Download from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) or [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/).

## Installing

Navigate to [Multi-Timer Releases on GitHub](https://github.com/demonfiddler/multi-timer/packages), download the latest Multi-Timer installer, then click/double-click on the downloaded multi-timer-installer-x.x.x.msi file. The installer package is not signed, so  you will have to answer Yes to the User Account Control dialogue. The installation is non-interactive and runs to completion without showing any further dialogues. Once installation is complete, you should find 'Multi-Timer 1.0' shortcuts on your Desktop and in your Start Menu.
